## Assignment 3

### Ariel University

_General Overview_

In this assignment, we were given several interfaces to implement; The Digraph and GraphAlgo interfaces. In order to implement them and to write the required functions, we had to use different data structures to match to our needs. In addition, we created various classes in order to achieve the best results and the highest efficiency levels. After completing this stage, we were instructed to build a class in which we finally presented the graphs.

_DiGraph:_

In this interface, we built
